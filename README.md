# CS301-Project 
Proposal
Our team will be investigating the problem of identifying dolphins and whales from their unique characteristics. In the present most of the research in this industry rely on the human eye, a technique that has a lot of variance and takes much more time. It is interesting because I did not think that these industries would still rely on the human eye, and this organization is also trying to help the conservation of marine life. The reading I will use to provide context for this would be this page, https://us.whales.org/whales-dolphins/, which help explains the different whale and dolphin species. The data I will be using for this analysis will be the images provided on the kaggle competition website found here, https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/happy-whale-and-dolphin/data, which display images that identify differences between certain marine life and help train the model used. The method I am thinking of using for this is DNN because it could learn from the traits to help train a model that could successfully identify marine life.The library I was thinking of using was the Elegy model to help train the model in deep learning by using JAX. The results that are expected are a steadily improving model that more correctly predicts the marine life based off of the images. We can achieve this by looking at the neural networks and weights, then evaluating the weights by looking at the gradient descent of these weights and adjusting them.
